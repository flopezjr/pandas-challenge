## Option 1: Heroes of Pymoli in 

Took what we took in class and created a dataframe for every table to displat an output.

I mainly created variables for columns and aggregating. I used the concept below.

#create variables out of columns and aggregating 
items = df["column_name"].aggregate() - count, mean, sum, etc

#create a data frame for display
data_frame = pd.DataFrame({
	"Column Output Name": [items]

#Analysis

Majority of players for HereosofPyMoli are male. Males make up 84.03% of the total players. On average Females purchase more per person but overall males spent $1,967.64 vs females who spent $361.94.A majrity of players are 20-24 and accounts for a majority of total purchases. How ever those less than 10 years old and those 35-40 had a higher average spending. Mythoughts on this is younger kids would tend to make purchases with out parent supervision. I would also say that it would be common for someone 35-49 would have a child less than 10 years old that could possibly playing on the parents account. Lastly, I noticed the one of the mostproitable item wasnt the most expensive how ever it was the most popular. Another popular item wasn't even close to being profitable and that was the Pursuit,, cudgel of Neocromancy whcih sold for a cool $1.02.
